Introduction
Everyday wellbeing is about how we feel, think
and behave. Nobody feels blissfully happy, thinks
positive thoughts and behaves sensibly all the
time. However, if you are in a pretty good state
of mind, it is generally much easier to enjoy life
and cope with its challenges.
Looking after your state of mind is just as
important as taking care of your body, yet most
of us manage our physical health far better than
our mental health. As soon as we feel a physical
ache or pain we generally try to do something
about it, but when we find ourselves feeling
very low or stressed we tend to think it is just
part and parcel of life and don’t do anything to
improve the situation.
If you do feel down, anxious or distressed, you
are not alone. One in four of us experience a
mental health problem in any one year.
The phrase “mental health problems” covers
many different conditions, ranging from mild or
temporary distress to problems which severely
limit a person’s ability to cope with everyday life.
The move from a mild state of

3

Introduction
anxiety or depression to a severe one can be very
gradual, but it is important to recognise the signs
so that action can be taken before the condition
becomes serious or prolonged.

or distressed,

The Secret of Emotional Wellbeing
10 basic skills for gaining and maintaining
emotional wellbeing
1. Set yourself achievable goals
Helpful Tips
Just as
achieving
physical fitness
takes time,
practice and
commitment,
so too does
achieving
mental fitness.

Set yourself some goals. Make sure that your
goals are specific and achievable. If they are too
vague you will never know if you achieved them.
If you set them too high you will end up
frustrated. Too low, and there will be
nothing to aim for. Write down short-term,
middle and long-term goals. An example of a
short-term goal will concern things to do that
day. A middle-term goal could be to make a
change to your lifestyle... like deciding to start
jogging. A long-term goal might be to learn a
new skill, change your job, college etc.

2. Be good to yourself
Take notice of your achievements, however small
and reward yourself. Think about what gives you
pleasure and enjoy the reward. Tell others about
your achievements. Giving time to activities we
find rewarding increases our sense of wellbeing,
whereas a routine made up almost entirely of
things that we have to do can have the opposite

5

The Secret of Emotional Wellbeing
effect. Doing things to put you in a good mood
is sensible, not self-indulgent; so don’t feel guilty
about it.
Helpful Tips

3. Believe in yourself

To build selfconfidence
and selfesteem:

Self-confidence is concerned with how we
feel about our abilities.
Self-esteem is slightly different as it reflects the
degree to which we value ourselves. You can
build up your self-confidence and self- esteem
even if it has been low since childhood.

• Behave as if
you’re more
confident than
you feel
• Learn from
your mistakes
• Speak
encouragingly
to yourself
• Do the best
you can, but
don’t try to be
perfect
• Spend time
with people
who make you
feel good.

4. Manage your time
Good time management means setting goals and
planning to tackle the most important things first.
Do not waste time on low priority jobs or spend
valuable time on things outside of your control.
Take 5-10 minutes each morning to plan the day.

6

The Secret of Emotional Wellbeing
Prioritise jobs in this way:
A = Absolutely essential
B = Better done today
C = Could wait
D = Delegate/ask someone else to do it
5. Face and solve your problems
We all have a tendency to avoid facing our
problems. Avoidance is not helpful in the long
run because it can make the problem worse, it
can create new problems and it stops you getting
on with your life and leads to more stress and
tension.
6. Keeping things in perspective
There is always more than one way of seeing
things. This means that although you may not
be able to choose the facts, you may be able to
choose how you react to them. You can help
yourself feel better and be more effective by
looking at your situation with an open mind and
being realistic about what you can manage.

7

The Secret of Emotional Wellbeing
7. Learning to relax
Practising relaxation will give you more energy,
decrease anxiety and irritability and reduce pains
due to tense muscles. Relaxation time should be
seen as an important part of your daily routine.
8. Expressing your feelings
Expressing our feelings promotes a sense of
wellbeing and freedom from tension. It helps
us to recover from hurtful experiences, and also
helps other people to understand what is going
on inside us. Of course there are times when
displays of emotion are not helpful, but hiding
or holding back our feelings can cause tensions
that affect our physical and mental health.
9. Managing your diet
The foods you eat can play an important part
in the way you feel, physically and mentally.
Too much sugar, coffee or salt can cause tension
and irritability, and alcohol is a depressant.
For general wellbeing the secret is a
balanced diet.

8

The Secret of Emotional Wellbeing
10. Take Exercise
Regular exercise is good for us in many ways.
It can increase our confidence and self-esteem,
stimulate “feel good” chemicals in our bodies,
provide an outlet for tension and frustration,
relieve anxiety, help us sleep better and prevent
some physical illnesses. Choose a sport or
exercise you enjoy. Try and go outside each day
and enjoy the natural things around you. If you
have concerns about your health or fitness speak
to your GP.
How to make health changes
Health Trainers are available to support people
who want to make positive health and lifestyle
changes such as being more active, managing
their weight, or reducing stress. This is a free
service.

9

The Secret of Emotional Wellbeing
Problem solving – one step at a time
Choose a problem that is causing you concern, then:
Write down the problem. Be specific
Write down a list of possible solutions
Write down the advantages and
disadvantages of each solution
Choose a solution and break it down
into steps
Tackle each step, one at a time.
If you have more than one problem, write them
all down and put them in order of difficulty.
Tackle the least difficult problem first.

Five Ways to Wellbeing
Five Ways to Wellbeing
Staying healthy is as much about your mind as
it is about your body. Here are five very simple
things you can do to boost your mood and
feel happier.
1. Connect…
If you feel isolated and lonely then your mental
wellbeing can suffer. Connect with the people
around you. Think of these connections as the
cornerstones of your life and invest time in
developing them. Building these connections
will support and enrich you every day.
2. Be active…
Getting active is great for your mental wellbeing,
as well as your physical health and can improve
confidence, reduce stress levels and boost your
mood. Go for a walk or run. Step outside. Cycle.
Play a game. Garden. Dance.
3. Take notice…
Be curious. Be aware of the world around
you and your own thoughts and feelings. It is
perfectly normal in life to experience stress and
anxiety but noticing these feelings and taking
some action can really help.

11

Five Ways to Wellbeing
4. Keep learning…
Learning new things throughout your lifetime
is good for your brain. It’s fun and can build
confidence and self-esteem.
5. Give…
Do something nice for a friend, or a stranger.
Look out, as well as in. Seeing yourself, and your
happiness, linked to the wider
community, can be incredibly rewarding and
creates connections with the people around you.

Managing Depression
Helpful Tips
Most people
recover
completely
from
depression.
You should
never give
up. Try to live
one day at a
time and keep
reminding
yourself that
you will not
always feel like
this.

Most of us have felt low from time to time, but
usually the low mood passes after a few days.
Sometimes, a person sinks into depression
to a point where they may need professional help
to get back to normal.
Depression does not mean that you are weak
or lazy. It is a common illness like high blood
pressure, diabetes or arthritis. It can occur at any
age. The good news is that there are things you
can do to help yourself and treatments that
work well.
Signs of depression
When we become depressed, we may
experience:
Loss of identify and self-esteem
Sadness, when there is maybe nothing to
feel sad about
Extreme guilt over minor matters
A sense of failure, when this is not realistic.

13

Managing Depression
Loneliness, even among other people
Tearfulness, when there is nothing to cry
about
Constant exhaustion
Feelings of hopelessness, misery or despair
Difficulty in concentrating or making
decisions
Thoughts of death or suicide.

When to seek help
You may be experiencing clinical depression and should seek help
if your low mood or loss of interest in life:
• interferes with your home, family or work life
• lasts for two weeks or more
• brings you to the point of thinking about suicide
Talk to your GP or contact one of the mental health associations
or voluntary organisation if you are concerned.

14

Managing Depression
Coping with depression
Helpful Tips

Avoid sitting or lying about doing nothing

It is important
to be active
even when you
do not feel
like it. Getting
going again
can help you
feel better

Identify things you used to do regularly and
things which you used to enjoy
Plan to gradually increase the routine of
pleasant activities
If a task seems too difficult, try breaking it
into a series of small steps
Above all reward yourself for your efforts
Avoid discussions of bad feelings. Solving
problems is more helpful
If your appetite is poor, eat small quantities
regularly and drink lots of fluids
Keep to a normal sleep routine. Avoid
daytime naps. At night get up if you are
awake for 30 mins or more, and do
something that will help you to relax
If you go off sex, keep some physical
closeness with your partner and reassure
them it is not personal but a temporary
symptom.

15

Managing Depression
Depressive thinking
When you are depressed there are changes in the
way you think, as well as in how you feel. You
tend to look on the negative side of everything,
see the worst in yourself, in your life and your
future. Once you are feeling down, you are more
likely to remember the bad things that have
happened and ignore the good ones. Negative
thinking can also trigger depression and it slows
down recovery.
Identifying negative thinking
Negative thoughts can be difficult to spot
because they become a habit, they can flash
quickly into your mind and most of us are not
used to noticing our thoughts. Learning to spot
and catch these negative thoughts is a skill you
can master with time. Some examples of
negative thinking are:
Thinking the worst, eg your boy/girl friend
doesn’t phone. You assume they don’t like
you any more
Ignoring the positive and only seeing the negative,
eg ‘The shelves I put up are no good
because one screw fell out’

16

Managing Depression
Taking things personally and blaming yourself for
what others do, eg ‘My son failed that exam.
I should have helped him more. I am a bad
parent’.
You may also have beliefs that are unrealistic:
I should be happy all the time
If someone is hurt by something I say or
do, I am a bad person
If I show emotion, I am weak
If I don’t succeed, I am worthless.
Changing negative thinking
You can learn to think more positively with the
3 Step Approach and this will make a huge difference in your life.
First, write down your negative thoughts as
soon as possible. If it’s difficult to notice
any thoughts, try noticing when you feel
down, and ask ‘What went through my
mind just before I started feeling sad’.

17

Managing Depression
Second, ask yourself ‘Is what I believe
TRUE?’
Ask yourself if everyone would have the
same belief
Think of other possible explanations for
the event
Try a different approach. For example, if
your friend doesn’t phone, call him or her
to ask why.

Helpful Tips
Assess your
symptoms
regularly and
consult your
doctor and/or
mental health
worker if you
have any
problem.

Third, balance each unreasonable thought
with a more realistic one. These should be
different to the unreasonable belief
Try to think of realistic statements
Try to think of as many alternatives as
possible.

18

Mood Chart
If you are worried about feelings getting out of
control, keep track of your feelings, thoughts
and behaviour on a “mood chart”. This will help
you notice anxious or negative thought patterns
as soon as they begin, so you can start using your
self-help strategies.
Make a list of specific feelings, thoughts and
behaviour that sometimes apply to you.
Only you will know what to put in these lists,
but here are some examples:
Feelings I am aware of:

• Sad				
• Lonely
Thoughts that bother me: • Nobody likes me
• I can’t cope
Negative behaviour:
• I’m trying to do too
much at once
• I’m avoiding people
Positive checklist:
• I am coping with life
• I am in control of my
thoughts and feelings
Give each of your feelings, thoughts and
behaviour a “rating” from 0 to 5.
0 = have not noticed any problems;
5 = things could hardly be any worse.
For an example of a mood chart see next page.

Alcohol and Drugs
Check your alcohol or other drug intake
People who are anxious and/or depressed may
try to cope with their symptoms by drinking
more alcohol, or using other drugs like cannabis.
This makes things worse.
Alcohol
Men should not regularly* drink more than 3-4
units of alcohol per day
Women should not regularly* drink more than
2-3 units of alcohol per day
*Regularly means every day or most days of the week
Also, try having some days off when you don’t
drink alcohol at all.
Young people under 18
Ideally children and young people should
not drink alcohol at all until they are at least
15 years old.
Look out for your mates - alcohol information and
links to services aimed at 16-24 years in Somerset
www.lookoutforyourmates.co.uk

21

Alcohol and Drugs
As a rough guide, there’s ONE unit of alcohol in:
half a pint of ordinary strength beer, lager
or cider
one small glass of wine
a single pub measure of spirits.
For more information on alcohol guidelines and how
to stick to them: www.nhs.uk/Change4Life
See Choose less booze

Other drugs
There are risks involved in taking any other
drugs. Users can never be sure of exactly what
they are taking, what the drug is mixed with,
and how strong it is. The effects can be
unpredictable. It is particularly dangerous
to mix different drugs, including taking a drug
and drinking alcohol.
Helpful Tips

effects and the law, go to: www.talktofrank.com

22

Managing Stress and Anxiety
It is normal to feel anxious if you are facing
something dangerous or difficult, but it is not
usual to feel anxious all the time or to feel that
anxiety is ruling your life. Severe anxiety is like
a “false alarm” – the body over-reacting to
something that is not really dangerous.
The most noticeable physical signs are nausea,
light-headedness, sweating, a racing heart,
palpitations and rapid breathing.
People often react to severe anxiety by avoiding
the situation that makes them feel bad. However,
this is not helpful in the long run, because the
more you avoid something, the more difficult it
will seem to you. It also limits what you can do
and does not give you the chance to discover
that the situation was not really dangerous after
all. Try making a plan to help you face your
feared situation, with the least frightening event
to be tackled first.
When people are under stress, there is also a
tendency to worry more than usual. Worry and
unrealistic or negative thinking can be triggers
for anxiety. People who get anxious sometimes
think in ways that bring on the

23

Managing Stress and Anxiety
anxiety or make it worse. You may also have
beliefs about yourself and about other people
that are unrealistic. Anxious people often
imagine that other people are judging them
harshly.
Helpful Tips
If your anxiety
is severe, seek
help. Talking
therapies can
help you feel
more positive
and in control.
Prescribed
drug treatment
can provide
short-term
help. Ask your
GP for advice
or contact
one of the
organisations
listed at the
back of the
booklet.

Coping with anxiety
Learn to relax and do relaxing things
Reduce caffeine and avoid using alcohol
Regular physical exercise will help
Make a plan to solve problems and
take action
Change the way you think.
Remember you can learn to think more
realistically and this will make a huge difference
in your life. Use the 3 Step Approach
(see Managing Depression).
Worry and negative thinking are habits which
take time to change.

24

Managing Stress and Anxiety
Slow breathing to reduce anxiety
Anxiety can make you feel breathless. The
natural response to this is to breathe in more
or to “over breathe”. However, this makes the
problem worse. The best solution is to slow
down your breathing which will stop the
unpleasant feelings of anxiety.
Remember to breathe in, using your abdomen
(not your chest). This is sometimes called
stomach breathing, because the abdomen should
gently rise and fall rather than your upper chest.
Helpful Tips
Remember the
technique of
slow breathing
sounds very
simple, will
take practice to
master but is
very effective.

Breathe in slowly through your nose to the
count of 3 seconds
Then slowly breathe out to the count of
3 seconds
Pause for 3 seconds before breathing
in again
Continue this exercise for 5 minutes or so
Practise twice a day for 10 minutes
(5 minutes is better than nothing)

25

Managing Stress and Anxiety
Try to check and slow down your breathing
during the day
Use the slow breathing technique whenever
you get anxious.
Relaxation Exercise
Before starting this exercise it is advised to talk
to your GP about the pros and cons of gently
tensing muscles. This particularly applies to
people with high blood pressure or a history of
heart problems.
Choose a quiet place where you will not be
interrupted
Before you start, do a few gentle stretching
exercises to relieve muscular tension
Make yourself comfortable, whether sitting
or lying down
Start to breathe slowly and deeply, in a calm,
effortless way

26

Managing Stress and Anxiety
Gently tense, then relax, each part of your
body, starting with your feet and working
your way up to your face and head
As you focus on each area, think of
warmth, heaviness and relaxation
Push any distracting thoughts to the back
of your mind; imagine them floating away
Don’t try to relax; simply let go of the
tension in your muscles and allow them to
become relaxed
Let your mind go empty. Some people find
it helpful to visualise a calm, beautiful place
like a garden or meadow.
Stay like this for about 20 minutes. Then take
some deep breaths and open your eyes, but stay
sitting or lying for a few moments before you
get up.

27

Panic Attacks
Panic attacks
Helpful Tips
The important
thing to
remember is
that feelings
of panic will
never cause
you any harm.
Your body is
simply gearing
itself up for a
non-existent
danger

Panic attacks are very frightening because they
seem to come out of the blue. Most people
describe a sudden, overwhelming sense of
anxiety, including:
Feelings of absolute terror
Very rapid breathing and heartbeat
Dizziness or faintness
Sweating and hot or cold flushes
Feelings of unreality.

Coping with a panic attack
Slow your breathing
Stay where you are
Remind yourself that you are safe and that
the feeling will pass
Try to distract yourself by looking hard at
something nearby
Face the situation again later.

28

Managing Anger
Anger
Anger needs to be expressed, because if it gets
bottled up inside it can cause harm or boil over
into rage. You are 6 times more likely to suffer
from heart disease if you are persistently angry.
Anger has to be expressed calmly, not aggressively. Remember that losing your temper is
never a good solution. It may provide temporary
relief, but later on you will feel bad, which can
lead to more anger.
First aid for anger
Breathe slowly and deeply
Slow down. Don’t rush into words or
actions you may regret
Count to 10
Walk away if possible
Do something physical like a vigorous walk
or housework
Take some exercise but not a competitive
sport as this can increase feelings of
aggression.

29

Managing Anger
How to tackle deeper, long-term feelings of anger
Helpful Tips

Talk to someone about the way you feel

If you want to
deal with your
anger STOP
blaming others
and START
to change
yourself

Ask your GP for help in tackling your
feelings
If it is yourself you are angry with, think
whether you are blaming yourself unfairly
Try to think about the bigger picture
Express your feelings in writing or painting
Practice techniques to make yourself more
relaxed and stress-free
Don’t take things personally
Recognise your own early warning signs.

30

Self Help
Self Help
When you are concerned about your emotional
wellbeing there is a lot you can do to help
yourself. You can also be helped by support
from family, friends or work colleagues. An
important thing to accept is that there are usually
no instant solutions to problems in life. Solving
problems involves time, energy and work. When
you are feeling depressed, you may not be feeling
energetic or motivated to work. But if you are
able to take an active part in your treatment, it
should help your situation. Self-help creates selfdetermination.
There may come a time when you feel you
might benefit from additional help. Help can be
found via your GP and specialist services such as
Somerset Partnership Talking Therapies Service.
Details of professional help can be found in this
booklet. The agencies listed in the back of this
booklet are also there to help you.
For more self help options see the ‘Suggested
Reading’ on page 38 and the list of useful
organisations and websites at the back of this
booklet.

31

Professional Help
Here are some steps you may want to take in
managing your problems:
Support from your GP Surgery
There are many sources of help to be found via
your surgery. A GP is many people’s first point
of contact when seeking help - a sizeable
proportion of most GPs work is related to
emotional problems. GPs can:
Talk through your problems with you
Talk about other sources of help in the
community
Prescribe medication
Refer you to the Somerset Partnership
Talking Therapies (see page 33)
Refer you to specialist mental health
services (see page 36).

32

Professional Help
Your Practice Nurse, Health Visitor or District
Nurse may also be able to help you manage your
mental health difficulties and discuss options
available in your surgery and community.
Medication
Sometimes when a person’s distress is acute,
their GP may prescribe medication. Some people
dislike the idea of taking medication, believing they should be able to manage without,
but there are times when it is the best solution.
Taking medication on its own is beneficial and
it can help you benefit from other treatments.
All medication has some side effects – usually
minor but it is very important to not stop taking
medication without consulting your doctor.

Talking treatment (Talking Therapies) is also
available privately and some non-statutory agencies
provide free or low cost counselling.
See useful organisations at the back of this
booklet.

33

skilled and experienced in managing complex

www.sompar.nhs.uk

If you are concerned about your own, or
someone else’s mental health, make an
appointment to see your GP. Your GP will be
able to discuss a referral with you to Talking
Therapies or specialist mental health services.

37

Giving Support
If someone close to you is experiencing
emotional problems, encourage them to talk
about their feelings and, if necessary, get advice
from their GP. They may need a lot of support
and their behaviour can be out of character
and worrying.
You can help by listening. Be reassuring and
encouraging, but try not to tell them how they
should feel or what they should do.
Show appreciation, small successes should be
recognised and celebrated. Anything that may
help the person forget their problems for a while
is beneficial. Practical help may be needed short
term with everyday tasks.
It can be very upsetting when a friend or relative
is distressed, and you may well find yourself in a
caring role that you did not choose. Ask friends
and relatives for help. Outside support may also
be helpful. Remember your emotional wellbeing
is important too! See the Carers organisations
listed at the back of the book.
